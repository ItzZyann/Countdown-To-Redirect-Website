# Countdown-To-Redirect-Website
This code will make a countdown timer to redirect on website after countdown was done.

Fell free to use my code, i mean my lazy code.
If you want to change the seconds to Minutes, besure its converted as seconds... Like 1 minute = 60 seconds...
You can just change the url xd!

Thats all, see you in new Web Coding Part 2!
